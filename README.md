# Containers and enviormnets
Containers for various uses
Contains sample Apptainer (formerly Singularity) definition files for creating a various linux based containers that includes essential tools for a development environment such as nano, Notepadqq (a Notepad++-like editor for Linux), Python, and a C++ compiler. I'll also include Git for version control, which is commonly used in development workflows.

Update:
This repo is now used to store all of the containers that could have various uses across systems. Specifically, the use of these containers has been tests in a distributed computing environment and may not reflect functionality on other systems. however these are containers and should be the swiss army knife you need for you next project.
